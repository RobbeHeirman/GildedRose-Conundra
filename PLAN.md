# Plan for the Gilded Rose Kata

## Step 0: Tech choice and setup
First choice we have to make is what programming language we are going to implement the Kata in.
As the job position i am applying for is mainly a Java role we will do the implementation in Java.

In the repo there is a reference to [texttets](texttests/README.md) This is great! this means we don't have to write
end-to-end tests ourselves. Followed the readme and checked if everything works accordingly. Reading into it the provided
"Golden Master" text with the current accepted output of the program.
