# Gilded Rose solution Conundra

## For the evaluator:
I will write down my notes in [PLAN.md](PLAN.md) More specifically this will be my train of thought during the exercise.
Specifics on how to run the code as tests will be in the readme of the implemented language(s).

## Implemented languages:
-  [Java](Java/Readme.md)

## How to use this Kata

The simplest way is to just clone the code and start hacking away improving the design. You'll want to look at the ["Gilded Rose Requirements"](https://github.com/emilybache/GildedRose-Refactoring-Kata/blob/main/GildedRoseRequirements.md) which explains what the code is for. I strongly advise you that you'll also need some tests if you want to make sure you don't break the code while you refactor.

You could write some unit tests yourself, using the requirements to identify suitable test cases. I've provided a failing unit test in a popular test framework as a starting point for most languages.

Alternatively, use the Approval tests provided in this repository. (Read more about that in the section "Text-based Approval Testing").

## Text-Based Approval Testing

Most language versions of this code have a [TextTest](https://texttest.org) fixture for Approval testing. For information about this, see the [TextTests README](https://github.com/emilybache/GildedRose-Refactoring-Kata/tree/main/texttests)
